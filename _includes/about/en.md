## About Me

Hey, I'm a backend developer who transitioned from a career path, currently still working at a company. I enjoy exploring interesting things, and recently I've been tinkering with building my own website and cross-border e-commerce. This website mainly documents my interests in AI, side hustles, and useful tools. My goal is to step out of the programmer's comfort zone in today's increasingly powerful AI world and try being a super-individual, experimenting with the currently popular "one-person company." I also want to be a digital nomad through action.

My current main job is quite busy, and I'm exploring the website and side hustles in my spare time. If you'd like to connect further, please contact me.
